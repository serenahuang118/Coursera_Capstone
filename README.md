Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods (Week 1)

Now that you have been equipped with the skills and the tools to use location data to explore a geographical location, over the course of two weeks, you will have the opportunity to be as creative as you want and come up with an idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of your choice or to come up with a problem that you can use the Foursquare location data to solve.

1) Introduction/Business Problem
Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.

Serena : THe purpose for this project is to help people who are planning to open an new restaurant in Toronto to chose the idea loaction with analyzing the data that we generated from our project to get the comfort to find the right location to open the restaurnt. The data we generated from this project is not only for the population and income level for each location, but also for their existing competitors locally. 

2) Downloading and Prepping Data
Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with the Foursquare location data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data.

Serena :I will combine use the Toronto's 2016-2020 Census data which includes popualtion, income, average income per neighborhood, working-aging, income growth and etc data and fourswaure APR to collect competitors in within the same region. 

Toronto's Census data is publicly available at this website: https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/99b4-TOHealthCheck_2019Chapter1.pdf

Toronto Neighborhoods' shapefile is publicly available at this website:https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/file-format-geospatial-data/shapefile?page=44

3) Methodology
Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, and what machine learnings were used and why.

Serena :I will be use several methodologies which could be helpful for the investors and enterprenures to deceide which location is the best for them to open new business. Beyond on that, I will also use the weather report which shows the historical, current, and forecasting weather for the target location.

4) Results
Results section where you discuss the results.

Serena : Now we know which locations/ regions are having more restaurant by comparing those maps. And some areas, although have less population, the number of restaurants are not reflected by that.

5) Discussion
Discussion section where you discuss any observations you noted and any recommendations you can make based on the results.

Serena : My initial idea to have this analyis is trying to final a good locatoin for the investors to open the new restaurant. I expect to find clusters of restaurants in the target region, unfortunately, my final result didnt meet my expection. 

6) Conclusion
Conclusion section where you conclude the report.

Serena : First, This report is very helpful and trustful for the investors who are inerested in finding a good location for them to open the restaurant. However, the result has the limitation since the data source we generated didnt cover all the aspects/ variables, such as, transporation, criminal case, car accidient case and etc.
